AutoCompleter (v1.1)
====================

Updated to Mootools 1.4.5 by Partikule - http://partikule.net

Credit: Harald Kirschner - http://digitarald.de/project/autocompleter/

This AutoCompleter script for [MooTools](http://mootools.net/) provides the functionality for text suggestion and completion. 
It features different data-sources (local, JSON or XML), a variety of user interactions, custom formatting, multiple selection, 
animations and much more.


Showcases
---------

See Docs folder of project

* Local Tag - Autocompleted tags in input fields and textareas, controlled by keyboard and mouse.
* Local - Countries Token array is filtered on client-side, not requested from the server.
* HTML Request
* JSON Request


Features
--------

* Use local data or Ajax request (JSON or XHTML) as data source.
* Look and feel like the OS, visitors can use it without problems.
* Intuitive navigation with mouse and keyboard.
* Customizable behaviour with a lot of options and events.
* Minimal effects to avoid noise in the workflow.

How to use
----------

### With JSON + PHP5/PDO

      window.addEvent('domready', function() {
 
          new Autocompleter.Request.JSON('fe-searchuser', '/query_user.php', {
              'postVar': 'search'
          });
 
      });
      
Your XHTML markup, no additional elements needed:

      <input type="text" name="search" id="fe-search"/>
      
And the example PHP for the database query:

      <?php
      // query_user.php
 
      $search = $_POST['search'];
      $result = array();
 
      // Some simple validation
      if (is_string($search) && strlen($search) > 2 && strlen($search) < 64)
      {
          $dbh = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', $user, $pass);
 
          // Building the query
          $stmt = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?");
 
          // The % as wildcard
          if ($stmt->execute(array($search . '%') ) )
          {
              // Filling the results with usernames
              while (($row = $stmt->fetch() ) )
              {
                  $result[] = $row['name'];
              }
          }
      }
 
      // Finally the JSON, including the correct content-type
      header('Content-type: application/json');
 
      echo json_encode($result); // see NOTE!
 
      ?>
      
*NOTE*: (If you are scared of the PHP 5 example) PHP 5 is not needed, this is just an example! There are classes and native solutions for all languages, 
more information is available here: [JSON.org](http://json.org/) (List at the bottom of the page)

The response for a "Har" search would look like:

      ["Harald","Haribald","Harold","Harry","Haribald"]
